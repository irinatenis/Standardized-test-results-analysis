# District-wide Standardized Test Results Analysis

---

### **Goal of the Project**  
Analyze school and standardized test data to identify trends in school performance, including how factors such as school size, budget, and type impact test scores.

---

### **Technology**  
- **Libraries**: Pandas  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook  

---

### **Steps Taken**

1. **District Summary**  
   - Aggregated district-wide standardized test results to create a high-level overview of key metrics.  
   - Metrics include:
     - Total number of schools and students
     - Total budget
     - Average math and reading scores
     - Percentage of students passing math and reading
     - Overall passing percentage

2. **School Summary**  
   - Generated a detailed summary of key metrics for each school.  
   - Metrics include:
     - School type
     - Total number of students (school size)
     - Total and per-student budgets
     - Average math and reading scores
     - Percentage of students passing math and reading

### **Key Insights and Trends**

1. **Reading Scores vs. Math Scores**  
   - Reading scores are generally higher than math scores across all school types.

2. **Impact of Budget on Performance**  
   - Higher spending per student (e.g., $645â€“$675) did not correlate with better test results.  
   - Schools with lower spending (e.g., <$585 per student) often performed better.  

3. **School Size and Performance**  
   - Smaller and medium-sized schools significantly outperformed larger schools in math performance:
     - **Small/Medium Schools**: 89-91% passing  
     - **Large Schools**: 67% passing  

4. **Charter Schools vs. Public District Schools**  
   - Charter schools outperformed public district schools across all metrics.  
   - Additional analysis is needed to determine whether this is due to school practices or smaller student populations in charter schools.

### **Additional Notes**  
This project demonstrates the value of exploratory data analysis in identifying key performance drivers in education. Future work could include:
- Investigating specific practices of high-performing schools.
- Exploring demographic or geographic factors that influence test performance.
